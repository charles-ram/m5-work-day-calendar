# Module 5 Challenge

We are creating a work day planner using bootstrap layout. The page will use jquery widgets to display calendar, real time, and time block. The page will also use local storage to save events entered in the timeblock.

# Current Todo List

1 - Display current date and set up interval function to continually display date.
2 - Create function to save event input to local storage and link it to the save button.
3 - Set up function to display past time-block in color#1, current time-block in color#2, and upcoming time-blocks in color#3.
